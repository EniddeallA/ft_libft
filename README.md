# ft_libft

My version of the ft_libft project at 42 school to implement a set of useful functions in c language and add them to your library for further use in upcomming projects.

The new version of the ft_libft project with all parts (Mandatory + bonus).

Feel free to use it to undestand the project, never use it for cheating!
